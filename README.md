# My name is Venkat Sai Jarugula
###### My favorite food is Chicken Biryani which is an Indian dish.

Chicken Biryani is cooked with **long grained flavored rice** called Basmati and pieces of **fried chicken** which is delicious to eat. And it is **served with thick gravy and yogurt**. Because of its aroma of flavored rice and nicely cooked meat, biryani is my favorite and I always love to eat it on special occasions. And my city that I come from is very famous for biryani called **Hyderabadi Biryani**.
