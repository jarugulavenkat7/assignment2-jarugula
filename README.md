# My name is Venkat Sai Jarugula
###### My favorite food is Chicken Biryani which is an Indian dish.

Chicken Biryani is cooked with **long grained flavored rice** called Basmati and pieces of **fried chicken** which is delicious to eat. And it is **served with thick gravy and yogurt**. Because of its aroma of flavored rice and nicely cooked meat, biryani is my favorite and I always love to eat it on special occasions. And my city that I come from is very famous for biryani called **Hyderabadi Biryani**.

# My favorite quotes 
>"All power is within you; you can do anything and everything. Believe in that, do not believe that you are weak; do not believe that you are half-crazy lunatics, as most of us do nowadays. You can do any thing and everything, without even the guidance of any one. Stand up and express the divinity within you."<br>
*- Swami Vivekananda*<br>

>"If you want to shine like a sun, first burn like a sun."<br>
*- APJ Abdul Kalam*
